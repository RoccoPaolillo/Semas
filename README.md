# SEMAS

This is the repository of the Python (3.7+) implementation of SEMAS (**SE**mantic **M**ulti-**A**gent **S**ysten), which integrates
Multi-Agent systems with the Semantic Web. 

![Image 1](images/QuLIO-XR.jpg)

# Installation

---------------

This repository has been tested on Python 3.7.3 64bit (Windows 10/PopOs linux), with the following packages versions:

* [Phidias](https://github.com/corradosantoro/phidias) (release 1.3.4.alpha) 
* [Owlready2](https://pypi.org/project/Owlready2/) (ver. 0.26)


### Phidias

---------------

```sh
> git clone https://github.com/corradosantoro/phidias
> cd phidias
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> pip install .
```


### Owlready2 

---------------

from prompt:
```sh
> pip install owlready2
```

### rdflib 

---------------

from prompt:
```sh
> pip install rdflib
```


### Setting interaction configuration

In section [LLM] of config.ini, the parameter *MODE* must be set as follows: 
* KG (OWL inference with OWL-to-NL response)
* LLM (only Query/Answer LLM)
* DUAL (KG+LLM) 


### Starting agent

---------------

First of all, you must create the ontology. In order to do that, you must follow three preliminar steps:

* Choose the owl file name, by setting the variable FILE_NAME (within AGENT) in the config.ini (test.owl for instance)
* Execute semas.py

```sh
Creating new test.owl file...

Please Re-Run QuLIO-XR.

Process finished with exit code 0
```

* Re-execute QuLIO-XR

```sh
Loading existing test.owl file...

NLP engine initializing. Please wait...

	PHIDIAS Release 1.3.4.alpha (deepcopy-->clone,micropython,py3)
	Autonomous and Robotic Systems Laboratory
	Department of Mathematics and Informatics
	University of Catania, Italy (santoro@dmi.unict.it)
	
eShell: main > 
```

Now QuLIO-XR is ready.
Unless you delete the owl file or choose to create another ontology, the agent will try to load every time the file specified in confi.ini.

### Ontology Learning

---------------

After having started QuLIO-XR agent, to feed KGs with *sentence* you must assert the belief FEED as follows:

```sh
eShell: main > +FEED("sentence")
```

For instance, considering the following sentences:

* _Colonel West is American_
* _Cuba is a hostile nation_
* _missiles are weapons_
* _Colonel West sells missiles to Cuba_
* _When an American sells weapons to a hostile nation, that American is a criminal_

QuLIO-XR will model the ontology in order to infer the further natural language assertion:

* _Colonel West is a criminal_

To let the agent model the ontology on this basis, you must execute the following lines:

```sh
eShell: main > +FEED("Colonel West is American")
eShell: main > +FEED("Cuba is a hostile nation")
eShell: main > +FEED("missiles are weapons")
eShell: main > +FEED("Colonel West sells missiles to Cuba")
eShell: main > +FEED("When an American sells weapons to a hostile nation, that American is a criminal")
```

Here is all taxonomic relations (by opening the ontology file with Protege) after the such assertions:

Here is all individuals. The number related to each sentence will always be different depending on the timestamp:

Here is all non-taxonomic relations related to the individual "Be.426837":
 
![Image 4](images/west-nontaxo.JPG)

Here's all axioms:

### Reasoning (ProtegÃ¨)

---------------

Thanks to all relations and axioms, we can make reasoning (Hermit/Pellet) and infer the following further
relations referred to the individual "Colonel_West.791305":

![Image 6](images/west-criminal.JPG)

Considering also the following small knowledge base, in order to test also *Value Giver Statements* properties and *Values Comparison Conditionals* axioms: 

```sh
eShell: main > +FEED("Robinson Crusoe is a patient")
eShell: main > +FEED("Robinson Crusoe has diastolic blood pressure equal to 150")
eShell: main > +FEED("When a patient has diastolic blood pressure greater than 140, the patient is hypertensive")
```
Here's ontology details like seen previously:

![Image 7](images/health-taxo.JPG)
![Image 8](images/health-ind.JPG)
![Image 9](images/health-nontaxo1.JPG)
![Image 10](images/health-nontaxo2.JPG)
![Image 11](images/health-rules.JPG)

In such a case, by invoking the reasoner (Hermit/Pellet) will infer that *Robinson Crusoe* belong also to the class *Hypertensive*.

# Known issues

It is well-known that natural language can be ambiguous, subject to interpretation about the semantic role of each lexical parts.
For such a reason out-of-common sense utterance might lead to unexpected triples, due to the dataset the dependency parser has been trained on. Still, as reported [here](https://spacy.io/usage/facts-figures), the model used for dependency parsing has an accuracy of 0.95, which means that some missful/wrong dependecy classification is expected, especially for longer sentences.
Beyond that, the following are known issues related to the code in this repository:

* Anaphora resolution/coreferentiators are not included in this code. So it is recommended to not use sentence containing pronoms, otherwise translation from natural language in OWL 2 won't be successful.
For this purpose, the integration of tools such as [neuralcoref](https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref) is recommended. Coders might include such a tool in their own fork of this repository.
* Sentence containing singles quotation marks (') are still not well managed. So, it is recommended to not use it, and, in such a case, to rephrase utterances differently.
* Occasional crashes during parsing of text may occur, especially during conversion from natural language to OWL 2. In this case, rephrasing/reducing utterances is recommended.
* IMPORTANT: all production rules are designed starting from a toy domain. Practical use involves a global review of all parsing rules and modules.
