centrality index by university, change through time, for each university:
- PhD students by subjects (ISCED 8) RES.STUDISCED8FOE*
- PhD women enrolled in PhD, ignoring subject (ISCED 8) RES.STUDISCED8WOMEN
- PhD men enrolled in PhD, ignoring subject (ISCED 8) RES.STUDISCED8MEN
- Covariates:
  + Number Eu-FP projects by subjects
  + HEI size
  + number of PhD students in previous year
  + education intensity
  + Erasmus incoming students
  + students previous year

In Semas, as an agent-based model, we need a stylized behavior that refers to the characteristics of the agent
- what are the characteristic of the agent we can identify?
	gender
	subject
	We don't have index of mobility (vs gender and parenthood)

- how to compute a probability? We are talking about choice:
	conditional logit (McFadden) exp(U)/Sum(exp(U)). This would need in the production rules:
	- data need to be flattened
	- if selected: compute utility for each university
	- compute selection via random wheel selection
	- select based on outcome (action-belief)

	Alternative: linear model regression, but it is about relation between variables
